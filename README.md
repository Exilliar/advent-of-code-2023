# advent-of-code-2023

Repo for solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Each folder contains the solution for one day. `q1.py` contains the solution for part one and `q2.py` for part two. The solutions have been written in either python 3.8 or 3.10. The inputs have been `.gitignore`ed. To run the solutions, create a file in the folder for that day called `input.txt` and then run like a normal python script.
